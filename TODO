Config
* Remove FirstBuddy* and replace with useful impl.
* Configuration via Signals.

SIP 
* Check SIP return codes (especially if registration fails and call fails) and state the reason (at least in the console)

Misc
* No references on pjlib.lib(); it might change if the SIPController reloads.


Style (keep everything readable <<)
* don't import pjsua as psjip
* avoid using PJSIP variable naming style
