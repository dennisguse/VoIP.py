Config
* Remove FirstBuddy* and replace with useful impl.
* Configuration via Signals.

SIP 
* Check SIP return codes (especially if registration fails and call fails) and state the reason (at least in the console)
* Register after audio device selection dialog (if necessary)

Misc
* CTRL-C does not work (after QT is opened)
* No references on pjlib.lib(); it might change if the SIPController reloads.

Ringtone
* Generate ringtone on ringing! (SIP:180)

Startup
* Only register, if audio device is selected (at least set ready only then)

Shutdown
* Nice animation


Style (keep everything readable <<)
* don't import pjsua as psjip
* avoid using PJSIP variable naming style
