Config
* Parsing NetworkSettings is not working
* Remove FirstBuddy* and replace with useful impl.
* Check media configuration
* Make config file a parameter (could be even the already read file); Are there useful XML wrapper for Python?

SIP 
* Check SIP return codes (especially if registration fails and call fails) and state the reason (at least in the console)
* Early-media is not yet working (no sound provided)
* Enable MediaConf

Logging
* Not yet there.... at least not yet useful

ENUMS
* If existing, then use else create!
